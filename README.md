# FitLit

### Abstract
For this project, we fetched data from multiple endpoints to display information on a dashboard. User is greeted with a custom welcome message along with their user information. Then the user is presented with a dashboard, being able to see specific activities based on day/week/all time. User's friend's step goals are also displayed alongside the dashboard.
