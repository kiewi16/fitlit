# FitLit

### Abstract
Data was fetched from multiple endpoints to display information on a dashboard. We also posted the data upon user input from the form. User is greeted with a custom welcome message along with their user information. The user is then presented with a dashboard that contains specific activities based on day/week/all time. User's friend's step goals are also displayed alongside the dashboard.
